## **📘 About Me**

I work in the technology field with experience in system design, software development, business analysis, and digital transformation. My main focus is turning complex business processes into stable, scalable, and maintainable digital platforms.

I have delivered more than ten internal systems for HR, Finance, Sales, Credit Analysis, Legal, Operations, Construction, and Executive Office. Most systems were delivered end-to-end — from pain point discovery and requirements to architecture, development, deployment, training, and continuous improvement.

I enjoy simplifying complexity, designing clear workflows, and helping teams adopt tools that align with real operational needs. I adapt quickly to new domains, collaborate well with all stakeholders, and focus on long-term value.
